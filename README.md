# Online Shopping – Software Engineering Assignment

This repository contains the report and requirements documents for the course **Introduction to Software Engineering**. The project is based on an online shopping platform used as a case study to understand software process models and requirements engineering.

The main objective of the assignment is to compare Waterfall, Incremental, and Spiral models and study how they affect real world system development. The project also demonstrates how requirements change over time and why validation is important.

## Purpose

This repository is created to show how software requirements evolve during development. It is part of an academic submission and represents a simplified simulation of a real project workflow.
